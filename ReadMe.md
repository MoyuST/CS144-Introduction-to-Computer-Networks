# CS144 note

Becaue of some reasons, i never took a computer networking course in my university at CUHK(SZ) which was quite a pity for me. thus i decided to find and study some online courses from other universities. after searching, i found so many people strongly recommending to take the CS144 from Stanford University and that's why i chose it.

## online lectures

since i could not access to the online slides, i decided to watch the available [recorded videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCMsyE1cvdWKsLVyf6cPwCLDIZnOj0NS) in youtube. however, i found these videos may be incomplete and just taught some very basic knowledge. maybe in the future i would still need to read some books to further study the computer networking. and i put all my notes in the `note/`.

## labs

this was the most wonderful part of this course. in this course, you would implement a simple TCP program together with networking interface and route with the help of the instructors. the testing cases given and the class encapsulation design really amazed me! after finishing all the labs, i just found myself a deeper understanding of TCP. My codes is put in the `codes` **branch of this repo**. and i also put my notes for labs in the `labs/`. my codes passed all the test cases with expected speed. i hope it could help you and give your some hints!
