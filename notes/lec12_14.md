## TCP service model

assumed host A and host B

3-way handshake
1. SYN from host A to host B
2. SYN+ACK from host B to host A
3. ACK from host A to host B

connection teardown
1. FIN from host A to host B
2. (Data +) ACK from host B to host A
3. FIN from host B to host A
4. ACK from host A to host B

TCP segment format
flags:
    - ACK
    - URG
    - PSH
    - RST: deliver data to application layer immediately
    - SYN
    - FIN

unique TCP identifier:
    IP SA + IP DA + SP + DP + PROTOCAL ID (+ ISN of both sides)

## UDP sercie model (User Demultiplexing protocol)
checksum is optional

## ICMP (the Internet Control Message Protocol)

making the network layer work
- IP
- Routing tables
- ICMP:
  assumed host A send a IP packet to router B, and route B cannot find the destination: route B would put header and first 8 bytes of the origin pakcet together with the type and code of error as the payload as a new ICMP packet and send it back to host A.

traceroute (TTL)
send a UDP with unreachable port
