## Flow Control

### Stop and Control

at most one packet in flight at any time. receiver sends ask when it recieves data. on receiving data/timeoutm sender would send/resend data.

handling duplicates using seqno.

### Sliding Window

allows bytes in flight

Sender:
    Send window size (SWS)
    Last acknowledgement received (LAR)
    Lasts segment sent (LSS)
    Maintain invariantL (LSS-LAR)<=SWS which is sender's bytes_in_flight <= peer's window size in lab

Receiver:
    RWS
    LAS
    LSR
    Maintain: (LAS-LSR)<=RWS which is receiver's stream_in.size() <= its capacity in lab.

RWS, SWS, and seqno:
    RWS>=1, SWS>=1, RWS<=SWS. generally, RWS+SWS seqno is needed to distinguish the delay ackno between old and new data.

### TCP flow control
sender should not send data beyond win+ackno

## Retransmission Strategy

- Go-back-N: one loss will lead to entire window retransmitting (one packet loss means all packets after that were dropped)
- Selective repeat: one loss will lead to only that packet retransmitting (one packet loss means only that packet was dropped). maybe slow if all packets in the window are lost in real time.
